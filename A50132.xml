            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <p>There was one very Remarkable Effect of it. His <hi>Father,</hi> was a man of a very Licentious Conversation; a Gamester, a Dancer, a very Lewd Company-keeper.

His <hi>Father</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to understand, at what a rate, the Child had pray'd with his Family, it smote the Soul of him, with a great Conviction, and prov'd the Beginning of his Conversion unto God. God left not off working on his Heart, until

               <p>This Hopeful Youth, having been Educated in Grammar-Learning, under a worthy Schoolmaster, one Mr. <hi>Sager,</hi> and in further Learning, under the Famous Dr. <hi>Harrison,</hi> at Length, about the Age of Twenty Two, he Entred on the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Employment of Preaching the Gospel.

About Fourteen years of his Time, in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he spent at <hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> and saw so many <hi>Seals</hi> of his Ministry, in that Countrey, that he seem'd rather to Fish with a <hi>Net,</hi> than with an <hi>Hook,</hi> for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.

Mr. <hi>Baily</hi> went on, in the Exercise of his Ministry, not pursuing any Factious Designs, but meerly the <hi>Conversion,</hi> of men to Christ, and Faith, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, which the Devil counts the worst of all Designs.

               <p>We will more particularly Note, a few No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, wherein the <hi>Holiness,</hi> which Irradiated him, will be described unto us.</p>
               <p>We might begin, with Observing, That the <hi>Holy Word</hi> of God was very dear to him, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is to every <hi>Holy man.</hi> Hence, I find this passage in his <hi>Diary. Jan.</hi> 11. <q rend="margQuotes">

                     </gap>es <hi>New.</hi> In the <hi>Beginning</hi> of every Chapter, it's good to say, <hi>Lord, open my Eyes, that I may see Wonders out of thy Law;</hi> And when we shut it up, to say, <hi>I have seen an end of all perfection, but thy Law is exceeding Broad.</hi> Oh! how terrible are the <hi>Threatenings;</hi> how precious are the <hi>Promises;</hi> how serious are the <hi>Precepts;</hi> how deep are the <hi>Prophecies</hi> of this Book!</q> But we will pass on, to some further Observations.</p>
               <p>What is <hi>Holiness,</hi> but a <hi>Dedication</hi> to the Lord Jesus Christ? This Holy man was often brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in himself, and pressing on others, that Great point, of <hi>Dedicating</hi> every thing to the Service of the Lord. Thus, in his <hi>Diary</hi> there frequently occur, such Strains as these. <q rend="margQuotes">Oh! that I may <hi>Glorify God,</hi> with all I <hi>am,</hi> or have; even with all the faculties of my <hi>Soul,</hi> all the members of my <hi>Body,</hi> and in all the <hi>Places</hi> and <hi>Relations</hi> that I Stand in, as <hi>Man, Master, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49296:23"/> Husband, Kinsman, &amp; Neighbour.</hi> Oh! I stand in need both of a <hi>Justifying</hi> Christ, and a <hi>Sanctifying</hi> Christ. When shall I sensibly find a Christ, Swaying his Scepter in my Soul!</q> Thus, whatever <hi>House</hi> he came to Live in, it came under a <hi>Dedication;</hi> and once upon a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, he wrote this passage in his Diary. <q rend="margQuotes">I could not but Leave my <hi>Old House,</hi> with a Prayer in <hi>every Room</hi> of it, for pardoning mercy.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But it was particularly Expressed; when one of his <hi>Children</hi> was to be <hi>Baptised.</hi> He thus wrote upon it. <q rend="margQuotes">I spent some Time, in Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up my self, and my <hi>Child</hi> unto the Lord, and in taking hold of the <hi>Covenant</hi> for my self and him. It is Actually to be done to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, [in Baptism.] I prayed hard this day; all this day, that I might be able in much Faith, and Love, and New-Covenant-Obedience, to do it to morrow. It is not <hi>Easy,</hi> tho' <hi>Common,</hi> to offer a Child unto God in <hi>Baptism.</hi> Oh! that's a sweet word, <hi>I will be a God to Thee, and thy Seed after thee.</hi> No marvel <hi>Abraham</hi> fell on his Face at the hearing of it!</q>
               </p>
               <p>Hence, when he parted with the greatest En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment he had in this World, he thus wrote upon it, in his Diary;</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">If I can but Exchange <hi>Outward Comforts</hi> for <hi>Inward Graces,</hi> 'tis well enough: Oh! for an Heart to <hi>Glorify God in the Fire!</hi>

               <p>From this <hi>Holiness,</hi> proceeded that <hi>Watchfulness,</hi> which Discovered a singular <hi>Fear of God,</hi> in his whole Conversation. I find him Entring in his <hi>Diary,</hi> such passages as these.</p>
               <p>At one Time.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">I did not watch my <hi>Tongue</hi> so as I ought; which cost me much Trouble afterwards, and made me walk Heavily. It's a <hi>mad Thing</hi> to <hi>Sin!</hi>

               </p>
               <p>At another Time.</p>

               <p>And as <hi>Holy</hi> men, use to be full of Hearty Prayers, and Wishes, for the Good of other men, thus this <hi>Holy</hi> man, has fill'd many places in his <hi>Diaries,</hi> with his Prayers for the Welfare of those, with whom he was concerned; from whence we may gather how full his Heart was of Blessings for his Neighbours.</p>
               <p>Once particularly I find him thus Writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">I desired to know of Dr. <hi>O.</hi> what I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to him, for those many Rich Things I have had from him: he told me, <hi>Nothing;</hi> [which was a great Favour!] only desired my <hi>Prayers</hi> for him.

               <p>Moreover, It was not only among the Great <hi>Signs,</hi> but also among the Great <hi>Means,</hi> of his <hi>Holiness,</hi> that he was very sollicitous, as well in his <hi>Preparation</hi> for the <hi>Table of the Lord,</hi> as in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49296:24"/> his <hi>Observation,</hi> of what <hi>Communion</hi> he Enjoyed with the Lord Jesus Christ, at His Table.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Diary</hi> abounds with passages of this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; the Expressions of a <hi>Careful Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Last Time of his being at the Lords-Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he wrote the Ensuing Passages.</p>

               <p>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">I spent some Time alone in Prayer, from 8 to 3. I was much tired. Oh! that I might wait for Returns, and never more turn to Folly. I can't tell how God should Admit me near Him, considering how I have grieved His Spirit. Having Pray'd in the Morning in the Family, I Retired; and first Sought at large unto God for Help to go through the day: especially begging <hi>Repentance,</hi> and not only so, but <hi>Faith;</hi> That I might not rest in the <hi>bare work;</hi> That <hi>Satan</hi> might get no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage after it; That I might have Reason to desire more such dayes. Then after a little Meditati n, and Breathing, I went to Prayer again, only to <hi>Confess</hi> my <hi>Sin</hi> before God, and to set my Soul as before the Lord; Labouring to Judge and Loath my self, for all my Sin, from first to last. God helped a little; but Oh! that my Heart was broken in pieces, and Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to the Dust. After a little more Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I went to Prayer, in way of <hi>Petition,</hi> and that at large. Oh! Lord, hear me, and give me the <hi>Wisdom</hi> that I want. I hope God will hear, pitty, pardon, and help me. After a little more Meditation, I fell to <hi>Praise</hi> &amp; <hi>Bless</hi> God for my Mercies, by Sea and Land; but was somewhat short in this part, for which I am sorry. At last, I Concluded all, in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Church of God in general, for

                     <hi>London, Lancashire,</hi> and <hi>Limrick;</hi> and for <hi>New-England</hi> also.

I spent Five Hours somewhat Comfortably; but after that I flagged. I Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to do Three Things. First, To spend some Time in Praising God for His <hi>Excellencies.</hi> God was with me, I hope, in that part of it, and I spent my self so much therein, that I was Disabled for the Rest. To help it forward God brought to hand Mr. <hi>Burroughs,</hi> of the <hi>Nature of God;</hi> I bless God for it. Atter that, I went to Prayer; Labouring to Exalt God; (It was a Good Time!)

                        <hi>Kindnesses</hi> to me.

            <p>ECclesiastical History mentions this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Disposition, in one of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive <hi>Christians,</hi> and <hi>Confessors;</hi> That when the Sworn Enemies of <hi>Christianity,</hi> Examined him, <hi>What he was?</hi> he would still give them no other Answer, but this, <hi>I am a Christian:</hi> If they asked him, what Countrey-man he was, or, what Employment he had, or, who were his Friends, or, any other matter, his Answer to them still was no other than this, <hi>I am a Christian:</hi> Thus he still Answered, although he ran the hazard of his Life, by making such an Answer!</p>
            <p>It is to be supposed, that <hi>Most,</hi> if not <hi>All,</hi> of the Persons, who Compose the Assembly, now together in this place, if they should be asked, <hi>What they are?</hi> would make that Answer, <hi>I am a Christian:</hi> And indeed there is no Danger; 'tis
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49296:31"/> a matter of some Credit, among us, in such an Answer. But then there is another Question, hence proper to be Considered: <hi>What is a CHRISTIAN?</hi> And it is to be feared, That very many, who wear that <hi>Worthy Name,</hi> can make, I either but a sorry Answer to that Question, or such an Answer as must carry their own Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and Condemnation in it.</p>
            <p>You are at this Time, to be Entertained with a Discourse on that Important Question. And we may fitly Introduce our Discourse, with some Enquiry into the <hi>first Original</hi> of that <hi>Name,</hi> CHRISTIANS; which Enquiry may Receive satisfactiion, from the words now Read unto us.</p>
            <p>The Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, was begun to be Preached unto the <hi>Gentiles: Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och</hi> particularly was a City of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> where the Preaching of the Gospel was Crowned with a great Success. And at thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Antioch</hi> it was, that the Name of CHRISTIANS, was first put upon the people, who <hi>Received the Love of the Truth</hi> of that Gospel. It had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, as a thing to come to pass at the coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> in Mic. 4.5. <hi>We will walk in the Name of the Lord our God for ever and ever!</hi> And there now seems a partial completion of this prediction, in our having the Name of CHRISTIANS; for CHRIST, is the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>the Lord our God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have Two Things here before us, that seem Remarkable.</p>
            <pb n="60" facs="tcp:49296:32"/>
            <p>First, We have the <hi>Name,</hi> which was betimes fastned upon the <hi>Disciples</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ. This Blessed people, had hitherto cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led one another, by the Name of <hi>Disciples,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their subjection to the Instruction, and Protection, and Government, of the Lord Jesus Christ. Because of their <hi>Faith</hi> also, they call'd one another <hi>Believers;</hi> Because of their <hi>Love,</hi> they call'd one another <hi>Brethren;</hi> and they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led one another <hi>Saints,</hi> because of their <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi> unto the Lord. Their Enemies all this while, called them <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> and <hi>Galilaeans,</hi> because our Lord was Conceived, and had Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided at <hi>Nazareth</hi> in <hi>Galilee;</hi> and His Apostles were mostly of that Countrey. But now, the Honourable Name of CHRISTIANS, became <hi>That,</hi> by which they were afterwards most of all distinguished.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We have the <hi>Place,</hi> where this Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Name first of all began. This was at <hi>Antioch.</hi> There were, it may be, no fewer than Seven and Twenty Cities of <hi>Asia,</hi> wearing the Denomination of <hi>Antioch:</hi> Which was occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by two several <hi>Antiochus</hi>'s, potent Princes, who founding, repairing, and enlarging the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Cities, procured them to be thus from themselves denominated: or else their Favourites took this way of naming Cities from them to be Recommended unto their Favour. But the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi> here mentioned, was undoubtedly That in
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49296:32"/>
               <hi>Caelosyria,</hi> the <hi>Metropolis</hi> for the Trade of these Regions. It was called, <hi>Antioch the Great;</hi> Behold here, as <hi>Great</hi> a Thing, as any that ever made it so: A <hi>Church</hi> of CHRISTIANS, here first wearing so <hi>Great</hi> a Style. The Evangelist <hi>Luke,</hi> who writes the Story of this thing, was a <hi>Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi> of <hi>Antioch:</hi> and behold, what a memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Note he Leaves, for the Everlasting Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Town, whereof he was a <hi>Citizen:</hi> the Style of CHRISTIANS, was never heard of, says he, till first at my Town of <hi>Antioch.</hi> It had been foretold unto the people of <hi>Christ; The Sons of them that Afflicted thee, shall come stoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping unto Thee.</hi> See now that prophecy in a small part fulfilled! In that very City, which had been the <hi>Seat,</hi> and still bore the <hi>Name,</hi> of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> the most Bloody Tyrant, that ever <hi>Israel,</hi> the people of <hi>Christ</hi> had groaned under, that people are now multiplied; and obtain an Appellation, which must be extended as far as any part of the Earth, which the Sun shines up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and continued as long as the Sun &amp; Moon Endure in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Two Things one would now Enquire.</p>
            <p>First, Who it was that first gave the Name of CHRISTIANS, to the <hi>Disciples</hi> of our Lord? Of that I say, It is not probable, That this Name was imposed upon the <hi>Disciples,</hi> in a way of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rision, by their <hi>Persecutors:</hi> Their Persecutors would rather have contrived a more Derisory or
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49296:33"/> Defamatory Name for them, and have call'd 'em, as one saies, <hi>Crucifixians,</hi> or some like Term of Contempt. It is much more probable, That the <hi>Disciples</hi> Assumed this Name to themselves, by their own Election The Greek word, <hi>CHREMATISAI,</hi> here used, for <hi>Called,</hi> signifies, a <hi>Calling,</hi> with some very solemn and signal, and singular Circumstances. Yea, 'tis related by <hi>Johannes Antiochenus,</hi> that <hi>Evodus,</hi> the Minister of the Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> at a <hi>Church Meeting</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with them, to take this Name upon them. It should seem, that there was a special Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from the Holy Spirit of <hi>Christ,</hi> unto them, for their doing of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly. Why the Name of CHRISTIANS; A Title derived from no person in the Trinity, but the <hi>Second;</hi> and from no other Character of that Second Person, but <hi>This?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of That I say; 'Tis only the <hi>Second Person</hi> in the Trinity, which took our <hi>Nature</hi> upon Him. Our <hi>Name</hi> therefore is very fitly fetch'd from that Second Person 'Tis only in CHRIST, and thro' CHRIST, that God becomes our God; and it is by CHRIST, that He does what ever is done for us. How Agreeably, are we called, <hi>Christians,</hi> to acknowledge this? As for the Name of JESUS, it signifies, <hi>A Saviour;</hi> Now none of us vain <hi>men,</hi> have any claim to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny share with our Lord, in His being so. Since, There <hi>is no other Name under Heaven, given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49296:33"/> men, whereby we must be Saved,</hi> it is not fit that this <hi>Name</hi> should be put upon any <hi>among men under Heaven.</hi> They who have call'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves JESUITES, in the Last Age, are a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous</hi> as well as a <hi>pernicious</hi> Generation. But the Name of CHRIST, signifies, <hi>Anointed.</hi> Now to something of This priviledge <hi>we</hi> also are Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced: The Apostle saies, <hi>We have Received an Anointing:</hi> And the Psalmist says, We are <hi>Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows with our Lord in this, tho' He be Anointed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove us all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus briefly dispatched these <hi>Two</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, there is a <hi>Third,</hi> which remains, to be the Subject of our further, and most serious Meditations. Namely;</p>
            <div type="part">
               <p>
                  <hi>What is a CHRISTIAN?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two <hi>Preliminaries</hi> are to be Considered.</p>
               <p>First; Many a man is not <hi>Really</hi> a <hi>Christian,</hi> that yet is <hi>Visibly</hi> so. As the Scripture sayes, in Rom. 2.28. <hi>He is not a Jew, that is one outwardly:</hi> Thus we may say, <hi>He is not a Christian, that is no more than outwardly so.</hi> Tis true, A mans being <hi>Visibly</hi> a <hi>Christian,</hi> is that which Entitles him to the External Priviledges of <hi>Christianity,</hi> in the Churches of God; <hi>Non Judicat Ecclesia de Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultis.</hi> But a man must be <hi>Really</hi> a <hi>Christian,</hi> if he would not perish among <hi>Infidels</hi> at the last.</p>
               <p>Secondly; A man that is <hi>Really</hi> a <hi>Christian,</hi> may have many <hi>Ʋnchristian</hi> Disorders in his Heart &amp; Walk. Alas, my Friends, All is not <hi>Christianity,</hi> that is done by every <hi>Real Christian!</hi> He was a <hi>Real</hi> and a <hi>First-rate Christian,</hi> who said, in Rom. 7.22, 23. <hi>I Delight in the Law of God after the Inward man, but I see another
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49296:34"/> Law in my Members.</hi> Thus it may be said of a Good man; <hi>He Delights in every Good Thing, so far as he is a Christian man: but you may see such a man do many Things, that are far from Christian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Prepared with these Two Consideration, Let us now pass on to Consider, What a <hi>Christian</hi> is? What are the points of <hi>Real Christianity,</hi> which every <hi>Christian,</hi> as far as he is a <hi>Christian,</hi> does come up unto.</p>
               <p>Give your Attention, Sirs; Your Condition for Eternity, is going to be determined.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> A CHRISTIAN, is one, who Adores the Lord JESUS CHRIST, as very <hi>GOD,</hi> and who Accepts that Lord, as His <hi>own GOD.</hi> The man, who does not Look upon our Lord <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> as more than a man, is no <hi>Christian.</hi> The Old <hi>Arians</hi> were but <hi>Pseudo Christians.</hi> A <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> sees that our Lord Jesus Christ is a man, but he sees this man to be personally United unto the <hi>Second Person</hi> in God. This is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned as the First, and Grand, Article of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie,</hi> which is the <hi>Mystery of Godliness,</hi> in 1 Tim. 3.16. That our Lord Jesus Christ is no other than <hi>God manifest in the Flesh.</hi> A man may be a notable Preacher of <hi>Christ,</hi> and write whole Books, about, <hi>The Knowledge of Christ,</hi> and yet not be a <hi>Christian.</hi> Mighty Numbers of those <hi>Hereticks,</hi> which are called <hi>Socinians,</hi> do at this day cover the face of <hi>Christendome,</hi> as the <hi>Frogs</hi> did <hi>Egypt</hi> of old: They hold, that our Lord Jesus Christ, is God, not by <hi>Nature,</hi> but only by <hi>Office;</hi> and not from <hi>Eternity,</hi> but only
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49296:34"/> since His <hi>Resurrection.</hi> The <hi>Mahometans</hi> are as Good <hi>Christians,</hi> as these miserable <hi>Hereticks;</hi> for the <hi>Mahometans</hi> grant our Blessed <hi>Jesus,</hi> to be a Glorious <hi>Prophet</hi> of God. Yea, there are better <hi>Christians</hi> than these, among the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans;</hi> for there is a Potent Sect lately risen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> called, <hi>The Good Followers of the Messiah,</hi> who hold that our <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>God, and the Redeemer of the World.</hi> No, A <hi>Christian,</hi> is one, who counts himself Robb'd, of all his <hi>Hope,</hi> and all his <hi>Joy,</hi> and all his <hi>Life,</hi> if the <hi>God-Head</hi> of his Lord Jesus Christ, should be questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. A <hi>Christian</hi> expects from his Lord, such a <hi>Righteousness</hi> as will Entitle him to Life, and such a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> as to Expiate all his Guilt, and such a <hi>Spirit,</hi> as will Sanctify him throughout, and at last Raise him out of the Dust, unto Heavenly and Eternal Glory. Now the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all this Expectation in the Christian, is, <hi>My Christ is God as well as Man!</hi> When the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical Writings have called our Lord Jesus Christ, The <hi>True God,</hi> and, The <hi>Great God,</hi> and <hi>God over all;</hi> the <hi>Christian</hi> is one that Heartily Subscribes unto it. The <hi>Christian</hi> thinks of the Lord Jesus Christ, That this His Lord, <hi>Is every where,</hi> and, <hi>Knows every thing,</hi> and, That His Lord is, <hi>The Lord God Omnipotent,</hi> and, <hi>That all Things were made by Him,</hi> and, <hi>That He Upholds all Things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There were <hi>Christians</hi> in the Dayes of the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49296:35"/>
                  <hi>Old Testament;</hi> All the Faithful People of the <hi>God of Abraham,</hi> were <hi>Christians,</hi> tho' that Name were not yet Formally put upon them. Now those old <hi>Christians,</hi> did Worship the <hi>Messiah</hi> as <hi>God: Joshua</hi> did so. <hi>Jacob</hi> was one of those old <hi>Christians;</hi> and he said of the <hi>Messiah, This is the God that fed me all my Life Long. Job</hi> was another of them; and he said, <hi>In my Flesh, I shall see God:</hi> From whence, even a Jewish Rabbi, who was no <hi>Christian,</hi> infers, <hi>The Word of God will take Flesh in a Woman on Earth. David</hi> was a <hi>Christian;</hi> and he said of the <hi>Anointed One,</hi> our <hi>Christ,</hi> in Psal. 45.7. <hi>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever. Isaiah</hi> was a <hi>Christian;</hi> and he said, of the <hi>Christ,</hi> who is <hi>the Child born, the Son given unto us,</hi> in Isa. 9.6. <hi>His Name shall be, God, The Mighty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Unless our Lord Jesus Christ, be unto a man, <hi>God</hi> as well as <hi>Man,</hi> and the very <hi>God,</hi> whose <hi>Name alone is JEHOVAH,</hi> That man cannot be a <hi>Christian.</hi> The <hi>Christian</hi> accounts our Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>The God, which is, and which was, and which is to come;</hi> that is to say, The Eternal JEHOVAH. The <hi>Christians</hi> of the <hi>Old-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> were of this Apprehension; and therefore, in multitudes of passages, concerning the Works of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> all over the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> the Name of JEHOVAH is Ascribed unto Him. [Thus in Zech. 12.10. Thus in Zeph. 3.9. Thus, in Jer. 33.16.] The <hi>Jews</hi> themselves are so
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49296:35"/> sensible of This, that tho' they Deny our <hi>Jesus</hi> to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> yet several of their own Rabbi's, do confess, That when the Messiah comes, he shall be called, <hi>The Eternal JEHOVAH;</hi> and, that the <hi>Messiah,</hi> is intended when 'tis said, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah shall build up Jerusalem.</hi> There was a <hi>man,</hi> whom the Jews did Stab with a <hi>Sword.</hi> But the Old <hi>Christians</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> look'd upon that man, to be Assum'd by the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God, into one person with Himself; Hence, they reckoned, the <hi>Messiah,</hi> to be the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God; and as in Zech. 13.7. that <hi>Stab'd man,</hi> they saw, was a <hi>Fellow,</hi> an Aequal, unto <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the Lord of Hosts.</p>
               <p>But when the <hi>Christian</hi> sees the Demonstration of this <hi>Mystery,</hi> That his Lord Jesus Christ, is very <hi>God,</hi> and by an ineffable Generation from all Eternity, <hi>The Son of God,</hi> he does there <hi>on,</hi> and there <hi>fore,</hi> make choice of this Lord, for his <hi>own God.</hi> The Language of the <hi>Christian,</hi> is that which <hi>Thomas</hi> used when he saw our <hi>Christ,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter His <hi>Resurrection</hi> from the Dead, in Joh. 20.28. <hi>My Lord, and my God!</hi> That famous Roman Pagan Governour, <hi>Pliny,</hi> gave this Description of the <hi>Christians,</hi> in his Time, <hi>That they Sang Hymns unto one CHRIST, as unto a GOD.</hi> Sirs, If we are <hi>Christians,</hi> We offer up our Praises and our Prayers, unto our CHRIST, as our <hi>God;</hi> and as unto <hi>God,</hi> we devote our selves unto Him. It was usual with the ancient <hi>Idolaters,</hi> to <hi>Brand</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:49296:36"/> themselves, in token of their Devotion to the <hi>Idols,</hi> whose <hi>Brands</hi> they wore, with such Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, as are forbidden in <hi>Leviticus.</hi> With a Golden, or an Iron Stamp, they sometimes <hi>Branded</hi> themselves, with the <hi>Mark</hi> of their <hi>Idol;</hi> as a <hi>Thunderbolt</hi> was the <hi>Mark</hi> of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> an <hi>Helmet</hi> of <hi>Mars,</hi> an <hi>Ivy</hi> of <hi>Bacchus.</hi> They some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Branded</hi> themselves, with the <hi>Name</hi> of their <hi>Idol</hi> at large; as <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or, <hi>Mercurius,</hi> and the like. And they some times <hi>Branded</hi> themselves, with the <hi>Number</hi> of his <hi>Name;</hi> that is, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Letters</hi> privately agreed by the Fraternity, which together would amount unto the same <hi>Number,</hi> with the Known Letters of his <hi>Name.</hi> I will not Report what some zealous <hi>Christians</hi> in the Primitive Times, did in opposition to this <hi>Idolatry.</hi> But this I will say; Every <hi>Christian</hi> does <hi>brand</hi> himself, with a certain <hi>Stamp,</hi> in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, That CHRIST is the <hi>God,</hi> whom he devotes himself unto; Now, the Name of, A CHRISTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AN, is that <hi>Stamp:</hi> As long as he wears the Name of, A CHRISTIAN, he thinks, CHRIST is <hi>my God; I am to Trust Him, Fear Him, Love Him, as my God forever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no <hi>Christian,</hi> who does not Receive the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> as an Article of his <hi>Creed.</hi> Now, a <hi>Jew</hi> lately Turn'd <hi>Christian,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieved it with this peculiar Emphasis. It is said, [for so <hi>he</hi> Read it, and <hi>we</hi> may Read it so,] in Deut. 6.4. <hi>Hear O Israel, The Lord, our God, the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49296:36"/> Lord, are One.</hi> Behold, sayes he, Here are <hi>Three;</hi> and yet it is added, These Three are but one. But it is the <hi>Second Person,</hi> that here more Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently chooses to be called, <hi>Our God,</hi> because <hi>He</hi> would more especially be <hi>Ours</hi> by Taking <hi>Our</hi> Flesh and Blood upon Himself; and it is <hi>in Him,</hi> that God becomes <hi>Ours.</hi> Truly, A <hi>Christian</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds the Lord Jesus God, as that <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> wherein God becomes eminently <hi>Ours,</hi> and he cryes out, <hi>Oh! my God, my God, forevermore!</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>II.</hi> A CHRISTIAN, is one well satisfyed in <hi>JESUS of Nazareth,</hi> as the <hi>Messiah</hi> promised of God, unto the World.</p>
               <p>The world was through all Ages Entertained with <hi>Promises,</hi> of a <hi>Messiah,</hi> to Redeem us from the <hi>Curses,</hi> which the Wrath of God for Sin hath brought upon us, and from the <hi>Mischiefs</hi> done to us, by that <hi>Old Serpent,</hi> the Devil, in our Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening unto him. These <hi>Promises</hi> are every where Scattered up and down, in the Scriptures of the Old Testament even from the Third of <hi>Genesis,</hi> to the Fourth of <hi>Malachi.</hi> Now, tis Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential unto a CHRISTIAN, to entertain the Blessed JESUS of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> as the <hi>Messiah</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in all of these <hi>Very Great and Precious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</hi> And there are espicially Two Things, that Convince a <hi>Christian</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>First, A <hi>Christian</hi> is Convinced, That in our JESUS, all the ancient <hi>Oracles</hi> about the <hi>Messiah,</hi> have their full Accomplishment. You'l easily
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49296:37"/> bring a <hi>Christian,</hi> to joyn in a Consort with the Song of <hi>Mary,</hi> in Luk. 1.55. In Him, <hi>God ha's Helped us, as He Spake to our Fathers.</hi> A <hi>Christian</hi> will soon be Convinced, That there did no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Thing befal our JESUS, but what the Ancient <hi>Oracles</hi> did foretel concerning the <hi>Messiah.</hi> And, a <hi>Christian</hi> will soon be Convinced, That whatever the Ancient Oracles did foretel concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Messiah,</hi> can be evidently found in our JESUS. Yea, any <hi>Rational man</hi> might be presently Convinced of This! There are especially Two Things in our Illustrious JESUS, at which the miserable <hi>Jews,</hi> are <hi>Scandalized:</hi> His <hi>Birth,</hi> and His <hi>Death.</hi> But in both of these, the <hi>Christian</hi> sees an Astonishing Accomplishment, of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, in the Ancient Oracles of God. The <hi>Messiah</hi> was to be <hi>Born,</hi> before the Tribe of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> should be utterly Stript of Lawgivers; and while the <hi>Second Temple</hi> was yet standing; and within Four-hundred and Ninety Years, after the Proclamation of <hi>Cyrus</hi> for the Rebuilding of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> Now sayes the <hi>Christian, So was my Blessed Jesus!</hi> The <hi>Messiah</hi> was to be <hi>Born,</hi> at <hi>Bethlehem;</hi> and, <hi>Born</hi> of a <hi>Virgin;</hi> and, <hi>Born</hi> of <hi>Obscure Parentage.</hi> Now sayes the <hi>Christian, So was my Blessed Jesus!</hi> The <hi>Messiah</hi> was to Ride upon an <hi>Ass Colt,</hi> when He came to Work out our Salvation. Sayes the <hi>Christian, My Jesus did so!</hi> The <hi>Messiah</hi> was to be <hi>Despised</hi> and <hi>Rejected</hi> of His own Country-men. If the <hi>Messiah</hi> be not yet come, then whenever He does come, the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49296:37"/>
                  <hi>Jews</hi> are to deal with Him, just as they did with our <hi>Jesus.</hi> Upon this the <hi>Christian</hi> sayes, <hi>No, my Jesus was He!</hi> The <hi>Messiah,</hi> after His being a Publick Preacher <hi>Three years and an half,</hi> was to be made a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for the Sins of men, &amp; thereupon the <hi>City</hi> and the <hi>Temple</hi> were to fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l under horrible <hi>Desolations. Was it not so with my Jesus?</hi> Will the <hi>Christian</hi> say. The <hi>Messiah</hi> was to be <hi>Betray'd</hi> by one of His own <hi>Disciples;</hi> He was to be <hi>Try'd</hi> and <hi>Judg'd,</hi> as a <hi>Malefactor;</hi> He was to have His <hi>Hands,</hi> and His <hi>Feet Pierced,</hi> that is, to be <hi>Crucifyed: Vinegar</hi> was to be offered unto Him in His <hi>Agonies;</hi> He was to be Rob'd of His <hi>Garments;</hi> He was to Suffer with the worst of <hi>Criminals;</hi> He was to be Buryed in the Tomb of a <hi>Rich man;</hi> like <hi>Jonah.</hi> He was to <hi>Rise again,</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were thereupon to come unto Repentance. All this was predicte<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>Again; A <hi>Christian</hi> is convinced, That th<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:49296:38"/> a <hi>Christian</hi> sees the <hi>Miracles</hi> done by our Blessed JESUS, he is convinced of our Lords <hi>Divinity,</hi> and convinced of our Lords <hi>Messiah-ship,</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately; and he cries out, <hi>Oh! This my JESUS, is the Son of God!</hi> The <hi>Christian</hi> is very sure, That our JESUS, wrought such <hi>Miracles,</hi> as are in the Gospel Related of Him: Stupendous <hi>Miracles</hi> wherein, <hi>The Blind Received their Sight, the Lame Walked, the Lepers were Cleansed, the Deaf heard,</hi> the <hi>Devils</hi> that were the Instruments of Inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such Calamities were cast out, and <hi>the Dead Raised up.</hi> The <hi>Witnesses</hi> of those <hi>Miracles</hi> are Incontestable. The Obstinate and Enchanted <hi>Jews</hi> themselves do in their <hi>Talmuds</hi> own those <hi>Miracles.</hi> But then the <hi>Christian</hi> is very sure, That God would never have permitted such <hi>Miracles</hi> to be wrought by our JESUS, if He had not been the <hi>Messiah.</hi> Indeed, a <hi>False Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> may have a <hi>Sign,</hi> accompanying of Him. Yet, such is the Compassion of the Good God unto the World, that something or other always <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>dhaeres to the <hi>Miracles of a Ly,</hi> whereby the Delusion may be detected. Whereas the <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> of our JESUS were such, that the more men Examine them, the more <hi>proofs</hi> will appear, of their being the <hi>Seals</hi> of the Great God, unto the Truth of all that He Declared. Our JESUS came, the <hi>Christian</hi> sees him coming, a man of Universal <hi>Holiness,</hi> and full of Endeavours to promote all that is <hi>Holy and Just and Good.</hi> He
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49296:38"/> Asserted Himself to be rhe <hi>Messiah;</hi> and for the Evidence of this Assertion, He not only did les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser Wonders, but also Raised the <hi>Dead,</hi> who had been divers Dayes putrifying in their <hi>Graves;</hi> and this in His own <hi>Name</hi> too: Yea, He Rais'd Himself also from the <hi>Dead,</hi> after He had been Stab'd thro' the Heart, and Hung Six Hours on a Cross, and Lay in a Sepulchre for Three Dayes together. If any man should ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously say, <hi>That all this was nothing but an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture of the Devil;</hi> God Almighty would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Pardon</hi> that man, throughout Eternal Ages! The <hi>Christian,</hi> upon the sight hereof, says like that Officer, who saw something of it, <hi>Certainly this was the Son of God.</hi> What says the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an? O my JESUS, There are no works, like thy works; Thou art the Messiah that was to come.</hi>

               <p n="3">
                  <hi>III.</hi> A CHRISTIAN, is one who Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges the matchless JESUS, to be the <hi>Priest,</hi> the <hi>Prophet,</hi> and the <hi>King,</hi> Appointed by God, for the Everlasting Acknowledgments of all His People. The Name of MESSIAH, which is given to our Lord Redeemer, it may be <hi>Seven Times</hi> in the Old Testament, is the same with CHRIST, which is in the New Testament gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven perhaps, above Two Hundred and Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score Times unto Him. The Name signifies, <hi>The Anointed.</hi> Now there were <hi>Three Offices</hi> of much Influence, in the Old Church of God;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49296:39"/> that of a <hi>Priest,</hi> that of a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and that of a <hi>King;</hi> and it was usual for them, who sustained these <hi>Offices,</hi> to be <hi>Anointed</hi> thereunto.

               <p>Particularly; First, unto a <hi>Christian,</hi> our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Jesus,</hi> is a <hi>Priest</hi> for ever. 'Tis said, in Heb. 3.1. <hi>Consider the High Priest of our Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, Christ Jesus:</hi> Christ Jesus is the <hi>High-Priest</hi> of the <hi>Christian Profession;</hi> A <hi>Christian</hi> makes <hi>Profession</hi> of being Reconciled unto God, by no <hi>High-Priest,</hi> but <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> A <hi>Christian</hi> is one who sees himself utterly unable to make that <hi>Reparation</hi> unto God for the wrongs done by our Sins unto Him, which His Just Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. He therefore flies unto the Lord Jesus Christ, as the only <hi>High Priest,</hi> that can Repair those wrongs, and make <hi>Atonement</hi> for him. What is a <hi>Priest?</hi> We have the <hi>Definition</hi> of one, in Heb. 5.1. <hi>He is one ordained for men, in Things pertaining to God, that he may offer both Gifts and Sacrifices for Sins.</hi> Now says the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49296:39"/> I know no such Priest, but my Blessed Jesus!</hi> The <hi>Christian</hi> apprehends the Lord Jesus Christ, as a <hi>Priest Sacrificing</hi> for him. He Assents to that in Heb. 9.26. <hi>He hath appeared to put away Sin, by the Sacrifice of Himself.</hi> He sees the Lord Jesus Christ, yielding both Active and Passive <hi>Obedience</hi> unto God, on the behalf of His Elect: He sees this <hi>Obedience</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ, as his <hi>Ransome</hi> from Eternal Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. All the Relief, that a <hi>Christian</hi> has against the Fears of the Wrath of God is This; <hi>Christ hath Loved us, and given Himself for us, an Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and a Sacrifice to God, of a sweet smelling Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</hi> Ask a <hi>Christian, How do you think to find Acceptance with God?</hi> He'l tell you, If he be a Christian, he'l tell you, <hi>'Tis thro' the Merits of the Obedience of my Lord Jesus Christ alone.</hi> The <hi>Christian</hi> also apprehends the Lord Jesus Christ as a <hi>Priest Interceeding</hi> for him. He assents to, That, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>He is able to Save to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, seeing He ever Lives to make Intercession.</hi> He sees the Lord Jesus Christ, as a <hi>Legal Surety,</hi> and as a <hi>Publick Person,</hi> gone into the <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> for us; He sees the Lord Jesus Christ, with our Names on His <hi>Breast,</hi> there powerfully pleading for our purchased Salvation. A <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> has nothing to support him under all his Daily <hi>Corruptions,</hi> and his Daily <hi>Temptations,</hi> but this, <hi>My Jesus is my Advocate!</hi> The Soul of the <hi>Christian</hi> even <hi>Lives</hi> upon this Cordial, <hi>My

               <p>Again, The Blessed <hi>Jesus</hi> is the <hi>Prophet</hi> of the <hi>Christian;</hi> the <hi>Shepherd</hi> and <hi>Bishop</hi> of his Soul; the <hi>Faithful Witness</hi> of God unto him; and his perpetual <hi>Counsellor.</hi> A <hi>Christian</hi> sees his Blessed <hi>Jesus,</hi> and saith with that <hi>Multitude,</hi> in Mat. 21.11. <hi>This is Jesus the Prophet.</hi> The <hi>Christian</hi> is one who apprehends the Lord Jesus Christ, as, <hi>A Teacher come from God;</hi> and, a <hi>Teacher,</hi> whose Acquaintance with the Counsels of God, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely exceeds all that any mortal man can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto: <hi>Jesus, a Prophet,</hi> (says he) <hi>Mighty in Deed, and in Word before God!</hi> Hence, the <hi>Christian</hi> Embraces what the Lord Jesus Christ has Revealed, as being the True and the Whole <hi>Will of God;</hi> He will <hi>Credit</hi> nothing, with a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Belief, and <hi>Perform</hi> nothing, as a Sacred Worship, except what comes from the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ: In every Difficulty, he will go to the Lord Jesu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Once more; The Blessed <hi>Jesus</hi> is the <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Christian:</hi> the <hi>Lord of Life,</hi> the <hi>Lord of Peace,</hi> the <hi>Lord of Glory,</hi> yea, the <hi>Lord of All.</hi> A <hi>Christian</hi> sees his Blessed <hi>Jesus,</hi> and sayes with
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49296:40"/> that Sincere Soul, in Joh. 1.49. <hi>Thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel.</hi> The <hi>Christian</hi> apprehends the Lord Jesus Christ, as the <hi>Master</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Lord of Hosts,</hi> and of <hi>Angels,</hi> the <hi>Man on the Throne</hi> managing all the <hi>Wheels</hi> of Providence: And as the <hi>Ruler</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> the <hi>Spouse</hi> and <hi>Head,</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> of it, and the <hi>Law</hi>-giver of the Conscience. Hence the <hi>Christian</hi> seeks unto the Lord Jesus Christ, for to have his own Heart Subdued unto the Will of God, and for <hi>Defence</hi> from all Interior Adversaries, and <hi>Conquest</hi> over all. Thus, he <hi>Recieves Christ the Lord!</hi> The Subjects of an <hi>Herod</hi> were called <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodians.</hi> Thus, a <hi>Christian</hi> is but a Subject of <hi>Christ.</hi>

But our Holy Lord Jesus Christ, who came to <hi>Redeem us from all Iniquity,</hi> exceedingly Resents it, if any <hi>Christians</hi> give Him cause to say, as in Ezek. 36.20. <hi>They profaned my Holy Name, and it was said, These are the people of the Lord.</hi> Now, every genuine <hi>Christian,</hi> is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully Afraid of doing any Thing, that may Reflect any Reproach upon the Name of his dear Lord Jesus Christ: <hi>Oh!</hi> thinks he, <hi>My dear Lord has Dy'd for me, and I had rather Dy than Dishonour Him.</hi> The Apostle has well put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these Two, in 1 Pet. 4.15, 16. <hi>Let none of you suffer as an Evil Doer, yet if any man suffer as a Christian, Let him glorify God.</hi> An <hi>Evil Doer,</hi> and a <hi>Christian,</hi> are directly contrary, one unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. A <hi>Christian</hi> and a <hi>Swearer,</hi> a <hi>Christian</hi> and a <hi>Drunkard,</hi> a <hi>Christian</hi> and a <hi>Railer,</hi> a <hi>Christian</hi> and a <hi>Debauch,</hi> a <hi>Christian</hi> and a <hi>Cheater,</hi> a <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian</hi> and a <hi>Lyar,</hi> a <hi>Christian</hi> and a <hi>Covetous Muck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm;</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:49296:45"/> What shall I say? A <hi>Christian,</hi> and yet a Servant of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> an Idolater, and a Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor! Oh! they are most notorious Inconsisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. A <hi>Christian</hi> is in vain called so, if he be not a better <hi>Husband,</hi> a better <hi>Father,</hi> a better <hi>Master,</hi> and a better <hi>Neighbour,</hi> and the better Correlate of those, than other people, for being so. Truly, Sirs If we <hi>Christians,</hi> are <hi>Wicked,</hi> or <hi>Worldly</hi> Wretches, we shall open the mouths of men, against our Lord Jesus Christ; and as in <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.7. <hi>They'l Blaspheme that worthy Name, by which ye are called.</hi> As <hi>Averroes,</hi> the Arabian Philosopher; he was much taken with the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> till he saw a vile Thing very common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; <hi>Ah, Now,</hi> says he, <hi>Let my Soul go among the Philosophers!</hi> Alas, Christians, we shall horribly wrong the <hi>Souls</hi> of dur Neighbours, if we allow our selves to do any thing, but what becomes <hi>Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The Pagans of old, called the <hi>Christians</hi> by the Name of, <hi>Chrestians;</hi> they mistook the Name, and it was now taken to signify, <hi>Good, Kind, Useful, and Sweet Natured People.</hi> Why, if we would be <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> we must be <hi>Chrestians;</hi> we must not be harsh, &amp; fierce and unserviceable, &amp; ill conditioned; we must be all made of Benignity towards all the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49296:46"/> World, and count our selves Enriched with any opportunity to Express Goodness, and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses towards all the Children of men. When the Heathen Emperour <hi>Severus,</hi> did see Two <hi>Christians</hi> most shamefully Quarrelling with one another, he gave order, <hi>Let those two Wretches ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be called</hi> Christians <hi>any more; Their Master Christ never taught them to do as they do.</hi> Even so, if any of you, <hi>Christians,</hi> do not lead Godly, Sober &amp; Righteous Lives, the Lord Jesus Christ Himself utters &amp; Thunders that Order from Heaven about you, <hi>Let not those People be called</hi> Christians, <hi>any longer; Tis a Dishonour to me, that they should be called so.</hi> In the Primitive Times, if a <hi>Christian</hi> were asked, <hi>Have you kept the Lords day strictly?</hi> he would Reply, <hi>I am a Christian, and I dare do no other.</hi> Thus, if it be asked concerning any of us; <hi>Do's that man Pray without ceasing, and bring up his Family in the Fear of God, &amp; deal justly, &amp; fairly, &amp; kindly with all the World?</hi> Oh! Let it be Replyed; <hi>Yes, He is a Christian; &amp; he dare do no other; he fears, he shall dishonour his Christ, if he do?</hi>

               <p>Christians, This tis to be a <hi>Christian;</hi> Thus the Name of our CHRIST is to <hi>Endure for ever;</hi> Thus men are to <hi>Bless themselves in Him:</hi> and I hope, you are every one of you, more than <hi>Almost Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,</hi> for to be such a <hi>Christian.</hi> God make every one of us, <hi>Altogether</hi> so.</p>
